We understand that for newcomers, the world of open source can appear daunting, with its multitude of files and issues. Even when a promising "good first issue" is found, it can be challenging to determine where to begin. That's why at Intellectia, we are committed to simplifying the path for new contributors to make a meaningful impact.

Our approach is to provide well-documented issues that serve as a clear roadmap to the problem area. We don't provide solutions; instead, we guide you on where to look for bugs or opportunities for improvement. Our primary goal is to create a welcoming and developer-friendly environment, particularly for students and open-source newcomers.

If you find our repository helpful, we kindly ask you to share this resource with your college community. Our aim is to facilitate real-world experience in large-scale project development. Please note that during the review process, we maintain transparency and offer constructive feedback. If you're open to learning and growing through constructive criticism, we invite you to contribute to our project. If not, we encourage you to explore other repositories for your contributions.

## Do we use AI?
Yes, we do utilize AI technology within our platform. We employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable our users to engage in conversations with `Intellectia` and seek answers to their questions. It's important to note that our AI system retrieves responses solely from our carefully curated database and knowledge base. These resources are comprised of trusted articles written by human experts and reviewed by human editors. We have a strict policy in place to exclude any content generated by AI algorithms.

The rationale behind this policy is to address concerns related to potential misinformation or inaccuracies that can arise from AI-generated content. LLMs, including those from OpenAI, have been known to generate persuasive yet factually incorrect information, which can lead to misunderstandings or inaccuracies. By relying exclusively on human-reviewed and curated content, we aim to ensure the highest level of accuracy and reliability in the information provided to our users.

Think of "Intellectia" as a vast library of knowledge that users can engage with through conversational interactions. We achieve this through the use of LLM technology, although it's important to clarify that we don't utilize OpenAI models specifically. Instead, we are considering the adoption of the "https://mistral.ai/news/announcing-mistral-7b/" technology, which appears to be a promising choice for our platform. This decision aligns with our commitment to delivering accurate and trustworthy information to our users while leveraging advanced AI tools to enhance their experience.

## Intellectia's Content Verification Process: Keeping It Reliable
To maintain accuracy in the articles you find on Intellectia, we take a special approach. See, it's really tough for computers to spot if a piece of writing was done by a smart AI like chatGPT or a human ü§ñüßë. So, we rely on real people to check.

Here's how it works: When someone wants to share an article on Intellectia, we don't just post it right away. Instead, we send it to a group of reviewers üë©‚Äç‚öñÔ∏èüë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è. These are users who are pretty smart in certain topics üß†. They pick at least three areas they're good at and review articles related to those topics. For an article to go live, it needs the thumbs-up from at least half of these reviewers üëçüëç.

But here's the cool part: These reviewers are chosen carefully üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüïµÔ∏è. We look at their past work and what they know to make sure they're the right folks for the job üîç. So, anyone on Intellectia can be both a reviewer and a writer üìùüë©‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è, making our community strong and dependable. üí™

## Why Become a Reviewer? üßê'
Ever wondered why someone would want to become a reviewer on Intellectia? ü§î

Well, here's the deal: Once a user becomes a reviewer for articles in a specific topic, Intellectia acknowledges their expertise. We do this by giving their profile a distinct appearance and a special, exclusive badge üèÖ, signaling to the community that this person is an expert in the field they review articles in. Reviewers stand out among regular users on our platform, making them easily recognizable.

But that's not all! We keep track of every interaction with the articles, including the ones reviewed by our esteemed reviewers. This means that all the articles reviewed by a reviewer are proudly displayed on their profile, showcasing their contributions.

In addition to this, we go the extra mile by featuring our reviewers across various topics in the GitHub readme section. This exposure not only boosts their reputation but also opens up opportunities for high-paying jobs.

Becoming a reviewer on Intellectia is not just about contributing; it's about standing out, showcasing your expertise, and accessing exciting opportunities! üöÄ

# Intellectia Setup Guide

## Cloning the Repository

```shell
git clone git@github.com:prasenjeet-symon/intellectia.git
```

## Database Configuration

Setting up your database for Intellectia is straightforward, with two options: XAMPP and Docker.

### Using XAMPP (Cross-Platform, Apache, MariaDB, PHP, and Perl)

1. Download XAMPP from the [official download link](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html).

2. Install XAMPP following the provided setup instructions.

3. Open XAMPP and start all services one by one.

4. Launch your web browser, navigate to [http://localhost](http://localhost), and click on "phpMyAdmin" in the header.

5. Create a new database named 'intellectia.'

### Using Docker

1. Ensure Docker is installed on your operating system. If you're uncertain about Docker installation, please ask CHATGPT for guidance.

2. After Docker is installed and running:

3. Open your terminal and navigate to the root folder of Intellectia.

4. Execute the command:

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

5. Verify that port 3306 is available on your local machine. If not, please stop any processes using this port; it might be due to another MySQL server running on your computer.

## Finalizing the Setup

After cloning the project, let's complete the setup, including installing necessary dependencies and creating required environment files.

### Creating .env Files for Server and Client

**For the Server:**

1. In your terminal, navigate to the server folder from the project's root directory:

```shell
cd packages/server
```

2. Create the .env file using one of these methods:

   - Using the command:

   ```shell
   copy .env.example .env
   ```

   - Manually create a new file at the same level as .env.example and copy the content from .env.example into the newly created .env file.

**For the Client:**

1. In your terminal, navigate to the client folder from the project's root directory:

```shell
cd packages/client
```

2. Create a new .env file using one of these methods:

   - Using the command:

   ```shell
   copy env.local.example .env
   ```

   - Manually create a new file at the same level as env.local.example and copy the content from env.local.example into the newly created .env file.

By following these steps, you've successfully added .env files for both the server and client, ensuring that each part of your project has its environment configuration.

### Ensure pnpm is Installed

1. Return to the project's root folder and run:

```shell
npm install -g pnpm
```

### Install All Project Dependencies

1. With pnpm installed, return to the project's root and run:

```shell
pnpm run app-setup
```

2. The initial setup may take a few minutes. After completion, your project is up and running, ready for development. The server usually runs on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001), and the client is accessible at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

### Restart the Project for Development

1. To restart the development project, run:

```shell
pnpm run app-dev
```

That's it! Your project is configured and ready for action. You can now delve into development, contribute to Intellectia, and enjoy the experience. If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to ask.

**Additional Information:**

- For Docker users, the MySQL GUI runs on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080), and the server's home is located at [http://localhost:3001/server](http://localhost:3001/server).
