## Do we use AI?
Yes, we do utilize AI technology within our platform. We employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable our users to engage in conversations with `Intellectia` and seek answers to their questions. It's important to note that our AI system retrieves responses solely from our carefully curated database and knowledge base. These resources are comprised of trusted articles written by human experts and reviewed by human editors. We have a strict policy in place to exclude any content generated by AI algorithms.

The rationale behind this policy is to address concerns related to potential misinformation or inaccuracies that can arise from AI-generated content. LLMs, including those from OpenAI, have been known to generate persuasive yet factually incorrect information, which can lead to misunderstandings or inaccuracies. By relying exclusively on human-reviewed and curated content, we aim to ensure the highest level of accuracy and reliability in the information provided to our users.

Think of "Intellectia" as a vast library of knowledge that users can engage with through conversational interactions. We achieve this through the use of LLM technology, although it's important to clarify that we don't utilize OpenAI models specifically. Instead, we are considering the adoption of the "https://mistral.ai/news/announcing-mistral-7b/" technology, which appears to be a promising choice for our platform. This decision aligns with our commitment to delivering accurate and trustworthy information to our users while leveraging advanced AI tools to enhance their experience.

## Intellectia's Content Verification Process: Keeping It Reliable
To maintain accuracy in the articles you find on Intellectia, we take a special approach. See, it's really tough for computers to spot if a piece of writing was done by a smart AI like chatGPT or a human 🤖🧑. So, we rely on real people to check.

Here's how it works: When someone wants to share an article on Intellectia, we don't just post it right away. Instead, we send it to a group of reviewers 👩‍⚖️👨‍⚖️. These are users who are pretty smart in certain topics 🧠. They pick at least three areas they're good at and review articles related to those topics. For an article to go live, it needs the thumbs-up from at least half of these reviewers 👍👍.

But here's the cool part: These reviewers are chosen carefully 🕵️‍♀️🕵️. We look at their past work and what they know to make sure they're the right folks for the job 🔍. So, anyone on Intellectia can be both a reviewer and a writer 📝👩‍⚖️, making our community strong and dependable. 💪

## Setup

**Project Setup Instructions**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:prasenjeet-symon/intellectia.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```
   cd intellectia/packages/server
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. **Database Configuration**:
   - Ensure you have XAMPP installed and running.
   - Create a MySQL database for your project in XAMPP. Note down the database name, username, and password.
   - Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env` in the `packages/server` directory.
   - Open the `.env` file and replace the placeholders with your MySQL database connection details
    
5. **Generate Prisma Client**:
   ```
   npx prisma generate
   ```

6. **Run Database Migrations**:
   ```
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```
   This command will create database tables based on your Prisma schema and apply any pending migrations.

7. **Start the Development Server**:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   This command uses `ts-node-dev` to run the TypeScript files in your `src` directory. It will automatically restart the server whenever you make changes to your code.

8. **Build the Project (Optional)**:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```
   If you want to create a production-ready build of your project, use this command. The output will be in the `dist` directory.

9. **Testing**:
   - Run your tests with the following command:
     ```
     npm test
     ```
     Modify the test script in your `package.json` file to specify your testing framework (e.g., Jest, Mocha).

By following these setup instructions, you'll have your Express project located at 'packages/server' connected to a MySQL database using XAMPP, with database migration capabilities using Prisma, and environment variables properly configured. Make sure to adapt the configuration and environment variables to your specific project requirements.
